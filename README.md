## Functionality
- **Attendence.py**: Handles the process of marking attendance by recognizing faces from sample images and comparing them with images captured in real-time using a webcam. Attendance data is stored in `Attendence.csv`.
- **Basics.py**: Provides basic functionalities for facial recognition, including loading sample images, detecting faces, and comparing faces.
- **main.py**: A sample Python script that serves as the entry point for the application.

## Getting Started
1. Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the main script `main.py` to start the application.

## Contributions
Contributions to enhance the functionality, improve efficiency, or fix bugs are welcome. Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues.

## Acknowledgments
- This project utilizes the `face_recognition` library for facial recognition tasks.
- Special thanks to the contributors and maintainers of the open-source libraries used in this project.
